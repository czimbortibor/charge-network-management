# Smart charging assingment: charge network management

## time spent

- 5%: understanding the specifications
- 35%: finding a solution to the most challenging part / designing the architecture
- 10% creating a repository with the basic architecture
- 50% meaningful coding and testing

## future improvements

- complete the remaining functionalities / rules
- add a better algorithm / data structure (hello graphs...) for solving the subset sum problem of listing the possible connectors
- more tests / add integrations
- have more care on to the database operations
- have more care on the entities
- logging
- improve the API endpoints
- improve on / fix the DDD patterns
